    <h1>My html notes</h1>
    <h2>basic html structure</h2>
    <p>This is a sample website where the intial code for this basic structure is given by visual code studio itself<br>
        Currenntly i am using this as a from of notes for now <br>
        Websites work in 3 stages namely-<br>
        client<br>
        browser <br>
        server<br>
        where the browser is used by the client to acess the server i.e browswer is a medium bwtween server and client.<br>
        In a website the front end is its design,placment of the icons page links etc<br>
        while backend is the brain of the website where the tasks you have requested get processed<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

    <h1> is a sample to play videos on html</h1>
    <video src="vid.mp4"controls width="300" type="video/mp4"></video>

    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/12/12/20/00/play-6865967_1280.jpg" width="100" alt="idk">

    <p>in this part i have used table tag to start a table where tr is used for the table rows th for headings and td for data
      <br> i also used row and col span to decide how many cells a data can span and uses caption thead and foot to label the table itself
