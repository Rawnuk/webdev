    <p>This is a sample website where the intial code for this basic structure is given by visual code studio itself<br>
        Currenntly i am using this as a from of notes for now <br>
        Websites work in 3 stages namely-<br>
        client<br>
        browser <br>
        server<br>
        where the browser is used by the client to acess the server i.e browswer is a medium bwtween server and client.<br>
        In a website the front end is its design,placment of the icons page links etc<br>
        while backend is the brain of the website where the tasks you have requested get processed<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
